# Blazor InteractiveServer vs InteractiveWebAssembly

## üöÄ 1. Execution Model

### Blazor Server (InteractiveServer)
- Runs on the server using .NET.
- UI updates are handled via SignalR (WebSocket).
- Latency depends on network/server performance.

### Blazor WebAssembly (InteractiveWebAssembly)
- Runs directly in the browser.
- Very low latency since everything is executed locally.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 2. Requirements and Resources

### InteractiveServer
- Low download size.
- Requires an active connection (SignalR).
- Low client resource usage.
- Lower server scalability (persistent connections).

### InteractiveWebAssembly
- Larger download (includes app + .NET runtime).
- Can work offline.
- Higher client resource usage.
- Better scalability (no persistent connection).

## üí° 3. Development and Compatibility

### InteractiveServer
- Excellent debugging experience.
- Direct access to server-side APIs.
- Compatible with older browsers.

### InteractiveWebAssembly
- Limited debugging tools.
- Requires HTTP calls to access server-side APIs.
- Requires modern browsers with WebAssembly support.

## üîê 4. Security

### Blazor Server
- Code is under server control.
- Easier to secure business logic.

### Blazor WebAssembly
- Code is downloaded to the browser.
- Avoid placing sensitive logic on the client.

## ‚úÖ 5. When to Use Each

### Blazor Server (InteractiveServer)
- Intranet-based enterprise applications.
- Immediate and simple compatibility.

### Blazor WebAssembly (InteractiveWebAssembly)
- Applications that need to work offline.
- Limited server resources.
- Complete backend independence.

## üß† Conclusion

- `InteractiveServer` = Blazor Server  
  Executes on the server, uses SignalR. Ideal for controlled environments and enterprise use.

- `InteractiveWebAssembly` = Blazor WebAssembly  
  Executes in the browser using WebAssembly. Ideal for offline-capable, scalable, and modern applications.

Both use the same Blazor component model but differ significantly in execution, architecture, and user experience.
